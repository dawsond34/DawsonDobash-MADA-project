Benjamin Caballero, Professor of International Health in the Bloomberg School of Public Health and Professor of Pediatrics in the School of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, discussed how to move from paternalism to partnership in research collaborations involving investigators in developing countries. Ames Dhai, Director and Head of the Steve Biko Centre for Bioethics at the University of the Witwatersrand, spoke about the role of ethics in making decisions regarding research collaborations in developing countries of varying economic status.},

  abstract = {A question central to the Covid-19 pandemic is why the Covid-19 mortality rate varies so greatly across countries. This study aims to investigate factors associated with cross-country variation in Covid-19 mortality. Covid-19 mortality rate was calculated as number of deaths per 100 Covid-19 cases. To identify factors associated with Covid-19 mortality rate, linear regressions were applied to a cross-sectional dataset comprising 169 countries. We retrieved data from the Worldometer website, the Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and Logistics Performance Indicators databases. Covid-19 mortality rate was negatively associated with Covid-19 test number per 100 people (RR\,=\,0.92, P\,=\,0.001), government effectiveness score (RR\,=\,0.96, P\,=\,0.017), and number of hospital beds (RR\,=\,0.85, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Covid-19 mortality rate was positively associated with proportion of population aged 65 or older (RR\,=\,1.12, P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and transport infrastructure quality score (RR\,=\,1.08, P\,=\,0.002). Furthermore, the negative association between Covid-19 mortality and test number was stronger among low-income countries and countries with lower government effectiveness scores, younger populations and fewer hospital beds. Predicted mortality rates were highly associated with observed mortality rates (r\,=\,0.77; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Increasing Covid-19 testing, improving government effectiveness and increasing hospital beds may have the potential to attenuate Covid-19 mortality.},

We present the Our World in Data COVID-19 vaccination dataset, a global public dataset that tracks the scale and rate of the vaccine rollout across the world. This dataset is updated regularly and includes data on the total number of vaccinations administered, first and second doses administered, daily vaccination rates and population-adjusted coverage for all countries for which data are available (169 countries as of 7 April 2021). It will be maintained as the global vaccination campaign continues to progress. This resource aids policymakers and researchers in understanding the rate of current and potential vaccine rollout; the interactions with non-vaccination policy responses; the potential impact of vaccinations on pandemic outcomes such as transmission, morbidity and mortality; and global inequalities in vaccine access.},

The Ethics of Research Related to Health Care in Developing Countries by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics makes a number of innovative recommendations that depart from codes such as the Declaration of Helsinki. It recommends that standards of care might be relativised to the standard of that nation. It recommends that very good reasons need to be given for not giving post-trial access to medications but recognises that there may be justifiable instances of this. It is the view of the authors that these and other recommendations of the report are sensible pieces of advice given the complexities of the developing world.}
